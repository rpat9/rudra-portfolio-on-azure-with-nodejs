# Node.js and Express Hosted on Microsoft Azure Template

This repository is inspired by [Eric Pouge's Template](https://github.com/EricPogueExampleCode-Webnode-js-express-and-azure-plus-fetch-template) that can be used to create a Node.js and Express-based website that can easily be hosted on Microsoft Azure.

# Key Features:

# Getting Started: 

- First I started with the background image for the website. After few minutes I found this amazing website from which I got my picture. Link to the specific picture: <a href= "https://unsplash.com/photos/gray-and-black-laptop-computer-on-surface-Im7lZjxeLhg" target = "_blank"> Unsplash</a>. 

- Next, I worked on the top bar. The <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient" target = "_blank"> Gradient Documentation</a> was an awesome resource from MDN that helped me pick the background color. Additional feature that bar has is that it changes based on device. Mobie devices will have a slightly different view than those on a laptop or wider screen. This was done with the implemention of the menu and close buttons found on <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/icons" target = "_blank"> Google Icons</a>.
