# Node.js and Express Hosted on Microsoft Azure Template

This repository is inspired by [Eric Pouge's Template](https://github.com/EricPogueExampleCode-Webnode-js-express-and-azure-plus-fetch-template) that can be used to create a Node.js and Express-based website that can easily be hosted on Microsoft Azure.

# Key Features:

# Getting Started: 

- First I started with the background image for the website. After few minutes I found this amazing website from which I got my picture. Link to the specific picture: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/gray-and-black-laptop-computer-on-surface-Im7lZjxeLhg). 

- Next, I worked on the top bar. The [Gradient Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) was an awesome resource from MDN that helped me pick the background color.
