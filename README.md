# Node.js and Express Hosted on Microsoft Azure Template

Rudra Patel - Implementation of Web Resume using HTML and CSS - Email: rudrappatel@lewisu.edu.

This repository is inspired by [Eric Pouge's Template](https://github.com/EricPogueExampleCode-Web/node-js-express-and-azure-plus-fetch-template) that can be used to create a Node.js and Express-based website that can easily be hosted on Microsoft Azure.

# Key Features:

- Built with Node.js and Express

- Utilizes Bootstrap for fonts and additional styling

- Optimized for development on Microsoft Azure

# Getting Started: 

- First I started with the background image for the website. After few minutes I found this amazing website from which I got my picture. Link to the specific picture: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/white-pencil-on-black-platform-tk9RQCq5eQo). 

- Next, I worked on the top bar. The [Gradient Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) was an awesome resource from MDN that helped me pick the background color. Additional feature that bar has is that it changes based on device. Mobie devices will have a slightly different view than those on a laptop or wider screen. This was done with the implemention of the menu and close buttons found on [Google Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

- After the top bar, I moved on to display the work. This section is going to get updated as time goes on.

# Styling:

- The idea behind the buttons comes from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4&t=22763s). Although the video is primarily Javascript, you can see the implementation of the buttons around 3:49:00 time mark. 

- The transform (size) effects are used by referencing [Transform Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform). 

- The gradient color on the header/nav bar is also referenced from [Gradient Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) mentioned earlier.
